    <h1>Disco DJ</h1>
    <p>Hi and welcome to Disco DJ.  Disco DJ is a modern web application
    and it looks like you're going to either need to use an alternative
    web browser or check the settings of your current browser to make
    sure you've got &quot;JavaScript&quot; enabled.</p>
    <p>If you don't have JavaScript enabled for accessibility reasons
    then I'd recommend familiarising yourself with
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">W3C's ARIA
    (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)</a> standards to which Disco
    DJ adheres. You should be able to get an ARIA compatible browser for
    free which will make Disco DJ accessible to you.
