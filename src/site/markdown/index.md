# About Disco DJ

## How it works

You add your music (and music videos) to the Disco DJ library. Your guests use
their phones and join the public Disco DJ wifi hotspot. Their phone will then
pop up the Disco DJ library from where they can then choose a song to add to the
playlist.

You can try a [demo of the library here](./discodj-web/demo/index.html).

Disco DJ then plays music

1. In the order your guests have chosen in the public playlist.
2. If the public playlist is empty then in the order you pre-define in a backup
   private playlist.
3. Randomly from your library.

which you can plug in and play with.
