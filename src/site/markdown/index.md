# About Disco DJ

Disco DJ is a requests based playlist suitable for parties.

## What is it?

It's a box you plug into an audio system and optionally a video system to play
back music from your music library. The box acts as a wifi hotspot which your
guests can join to request particular songs from your library to be played.

## How it works

In advance of your party you add your music (and music videos) to the Disco DJ
library. On the day of your party you plug Disco DJ into an audio system and
optionally a video system if you want to play videos. When your guests arrive
they can use their phones to join the public Disco DJ wifi hotspot. Their phone
will then pop up the Disco DJ library from where they can then choose a song to
add to the playlist. There's no need for them to download an app or have
Internet access.

You can try a [demo of the library here](./discodj-web/demo/index.html).

Disco DJ then plays music

1. In the order your guests have chosen in the public playlist.
2. If the public playlist is empty then in the order you pre-define in a backup
   private playlist.

## How to get it

The easiest way is to contact me and at cost I'll send you a pre-built Disco DJ
which you can plug in and play with.

If you've got some technical skills then this is what you need to do:

1. Get a cheap PC and install Debian Linux on it (Disco DJ runs really well on
   a Raspberry Pi and this is definitely a cheap option).
2.
