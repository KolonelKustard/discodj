# Disco DJ

Lets you throw a party and let all your guests easily request music but based on
your tastes. You choose your music for the night and your guests then use their
phones to promote songs they want to listen to.

## How it works

You add your music to Disco DJ, this then forms the library. Your guests then
use their phones and join the public Disco DJ wifi hotspot. Instead of seeing a
login screen like you'd see if you were joining a normal wifi hotspot they see
your library. They can then choose a song to add to the playlist.
